### Description

This Project makes API calls to ingest the most recent 8 quarters of financial statements filed by the S&P 500 publicly listed companies, then stores the data on a Postgres DB, utilizing the Adapter and Model-View-Controller (MVC) design patterns along the way.

A Flask API app allows the user to query aggregate and company-level data such as average quarterly revenue, cost, and price/earnings ratios, returning the results in JSON format in a web browser.

Various plots based on these data can be viewed in an interactive dashboard in a browser, where a user can select different economic sectors and sub-sectors, companies, and financial performance indicators â€” for example, a cross-sector comparison of average quarterly earnings over the last 8 quarters.
